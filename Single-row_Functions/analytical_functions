Analytical functions have the ability to return multiple rows from within a group of rows.
Analytical functions can operate across a window of rows.
Analytical functions are the last set of operations performed in a query prior to tge ORDER BY clause.
Analytical functions are forbidden in the WHERE, HAVING, and GROUP BY clauses.

***** OVER, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY *****
SELECT SUM(sq_ft) FROM ship_cabin;

#using analytical function: 
SELECT window,
       room_number,
       SUM(sq_ft) OVER (ORDER BY sq_ft) AS 'Running Total',                                  
       SUM(sq_ft) OVER (ORDER BY sq_ft ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS 'Subset'    # previous + current + following
FROM ship_cabins
ORDER BY sq_ft;

SELECT window,
       room_number,
       SUM(sq_ft) OVER (PARTITION BY window ORDER BY sq_ft) AS 'Running Total',        #results are divided into groups based on window type                              
       SUM(sq_ft) OVER (PARTITION BY WINDOW ORDER BY sq_ft ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS 'Subset'    # previous + current + following
FROM ship_cabins
ORDER BY sq_ft;

***** LAG and LEAD *****
LAG - shows a column's value in the prior row
LEAD - shows the next value

SELECT window,
       room_number,
       sq_ft,
       LAG(sq_ft) OVER (ORDER BY window, sq-ft) 'Lag',        # default offset - 1
       LEAD(sq_ft) OVER (ORDER BY window, sq-ft) 'Lead'
FROM ship_cabins
ORDER BY window, sq_ft;

SELECT window,
       room_number,
       sq_ft,
       LAG(sq_ft, 2) OVER (ORDER BY window, sq-ft) 'Lag',    #offset = 2 
       LEAD(sq_ft) OVER (ORDER BY window, sq-ft) 'Lead'
FROM ship_cabins
ORDER BY window, sq_ft;

***** STDDEV *****

STDDEV - returns the sample standard deviation of a set of numueric values.
(value representing a degree of distribution for a given numeric value within a larger range of values;
sq.root of its variance).

Eample: 
values: 1, 2, 4, 13 
1. Calculate average(mean): (1 + 2 + 4 + 14) / 4 = 5
2. for each number calculate difference:  -4, -3, -1, 8
3. calculate square of the result: 16, 9, 1, 64
4. sum squared differences: 16 + 9 + 1 + 94 = 90
5. caculate variance: 90 / (4 - 1) = 30  (squared differences / (number of values - 1) 
6. calculate standard deviation: SQRT(30) - 5.4777

SELECT AVG(sq_ft),
       MEDIAN(sq_ft),
       ARDDEV(sq_ft),
       STDDEV(sq_ft),
       VARIANCE(sq-ft)
FROM ship_cabins;

SELECT window, room_number, sq_f),
     STDDEV(sq_ft) OVER (ORDER BY sq-ft) 'Std Dev',
     VARIANCE(sq-ft) ) OVER (ORDER BY sq-ft) 'Variance'
FROM ship_cabins
ORDER BY sq-ft;

***** PERCENTILE_CONT *****

Uses linear interpolation between a given row's row set ceiling and floor to calculate the percentile value for that given row.

#display sq.ft for each cabin. For cabins with the same type of window, consider the largest sq.ft and calculate 60% of that sq.ft
SELECT window,
       room_number,
       sq_ft,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(.6) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sq_ft) OVER (PARTITION BY window) "PCT"
FROM ship_cabins
ORDER BY sq-ft;
