Scalar functions  - return one value for each row encountered by the SQL statement in which the scalar function is applied.
Aggregate functions - return one value for every zero or more rows encountered by the SQL statement.

Scalar functions can be nested multiple times, as long as the data types match (same level of details).
Aggregate functions - aggregates combine data from multiple rows into a single row (different level of details)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(MAX(sq_ft)))
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE ship_id = 1
GROUP BY room_style, room_type      #  771

- You are allowed to nest aggregate functions up to two levels deep
- Each time you introduce an aggregate function, you are rolling up lower-level data into higher-level summary data
- Your SELECT statement's select list must always respect the level of aggregation and can only include expressions that are all at the same level of aggregation.
