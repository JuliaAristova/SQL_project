Group functions - have the ability to process zero or more rows as a logical set, analyszed together to return a single-row result.

Input - zero or more rows
Output - one row

Types:
- Aggregate (multirow) functions 
- Analytical functions 

Aggregate functions - typically used with SELECT statement that selects many rowa
Analytic functions - consider a set of rows and process them as a single set or as varying subsets, including overlapping subsets.

Group functions can be called from:
1. SELECT list
2. ORDER BY clause
3. GROUP BY clause
4. HAVING claise

***** COUNT *****
COUNT(e1) - e1 - expression, any data type - determines the number of occurence of non-NULL values

COUNT(*) - counts the number of rows in the entire table

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors;      # 2

SELECT COUNT(vendor_name),         # 2
       COUNT(status),              # 1
       COUNT(category)             # 0
FROM vendors;

SELECT COUNT(ALL last_name),              # ALL - default operator
       COUNT(DISTINCT last_name)          # DISTINCT operator returns unique values
FROM employees;

***** SUM *****
SUM(e1) - e1 - expression, numeric data type 

SELECT SUM(subtotal) FROM orders;
SELECT SUM(subtotal) FROM orders
WHERE TO_CHAR(order_date, 'MON_RR') = 'APR-17'

***** MIN and MAX *****
MIN(e1), MAX(e1) - e1 - expression, data types - character, date, number; return single min/max value
  date - earlier dates ar MIN
  character - A < Z, Z < a, '1' < '10', '100' < '2'

***** AVG *****
AG(e1) - e1 - expression, numeric data type; ignores NULL values

 SELECT TO_CHAR( ROUND (AVG(salary), 2), '$9999,999.99') FROM pay_history;   # nested aggregate functions with 2 scalar functions

When nested - the aggregate function should be innermost function.

***** MEDIAN *****
MEDIAN(e1) - e1 - expression, numeric data type; ignores NULL values
Sort the values, returns number in the middle (odd) or linear interpolation between 2 values in the middle (even)

***** RANK *****

RANK: Analytic
