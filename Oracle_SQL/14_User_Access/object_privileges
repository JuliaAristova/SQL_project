OBJECT privilege - right to perform tasks on a particular object in the DB.
A user account, by default, has object privileges on the objects it owns.
Object privileges are required to perform tasks on objects a user account does not own.

Any user who owns a table (or any other DB object) may grant object privileges on their DB object to other user in the DB.

Object privileges exist for all DML statements: SELECT. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, and DDL statements relevant to an existing object (ex., ALTER).

GRANT SELECT, UPDATE Webinars TO Henry;

CONNECT Henry / pass;
SELECT * FROM Lisa.Webinars;      # Lisa schema prefix must be used

INSERT INTO Liza.Webinars values('New Entry');  # error message - no right to Insert - Insufficient privileges

***** SCHEMA PREFIX *****

SYNONYM - is an object in the DB that is an alternative name for a DB object.
PUBLIC SYNONYM - is a synonym that is owned by the PUBLIC user account, which is automatically created user account that is maintained by the Oracle DB.
PUBLIC is a mechanism by which you can create globally owned objects (anything that is owned by PUBLIC is automatically owned by all users in the DB).

GRANT CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM TO Lisa;
Lisa:  CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM Webinars FOR Lisa.Webinars;
Henty: SELECT * FROM Webinars;        # Webinars - PUBLIC SYNONYM which points to Lisa.Webinars

***** WITH GRANT OPTION *****

CONNECT Lisa/Poe;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON Webinars TO Henry WITH GRANT OPTION;

Henry can Seletc, Update, and GRANT these privileges to other users.

CONNECT Henry/RussFuss;
GRANT SELECT ON Lisa.Webinars TO Harold WITH GRANT OPTION;

***** REVOKE *****
Revokes all specified priveleges and cascades the change throughout all user accounts as required.

REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON Webinars FROM Henry;

Revocation of object privileges 'cascades" --> Henry and Harold will lose given priveleges.


***** ALL PRIVELEGES *****
Works with granting and revoking object priveleges.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on Webinars TO Henry;  # grants all priveleges except for the ability to grant privileges

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Webinars TO Henry WITH GRANT OPTION;   # PRIVILEGES can be imitted
GRANT ALL ON Webinars TO Henry;

REVOKE ALL PRIVELEGES ON Webinars FROM Henry;
REVOKE ALL ON Webinars FROM Henry;          #executed without errors even if there are no priveleges granted to user

***** DEPENDENT PRIVELEGES *****

User A - owned table A and view A based on table A, public synonym of table A
User A grants User B on view A (no need to grant User B on table A)
User B can see public synonym on table A, but needs privilege to see the table A

Note:
If you grant privilege to table and then drop the table --> privileges are dropped with the table too.
If the table is recreated, privileges must be granted again.
If you restore table with the FLASHBACK TABLE ... BEFORE DROP statement --> you will recover the table, its associated indeces, and tha table's granted priveleges.
