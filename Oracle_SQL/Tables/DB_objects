Schema is a logical collection of certain DB objects, such as tables indexes, and views,

Categories of DB objects:
1. Schema objects - owned bt a user account
       - tables
       - constraints
       - indexes
       - views
       - sequencies
       - private synonyms - owned by a uset account
2. Non-schema objects - cannot be owned by a user account
       - users - user account cannot be owned by itself or another account. It is a property of DB as a whole.
       - roles - one or more priviligies that can be granted to one or more USER objects.
       - public synonyms - available to the whole DB
