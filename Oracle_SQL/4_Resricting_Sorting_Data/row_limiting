SELECT * FROM orders
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;

SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY line_items                            # ex - 8 rows in total, line_item = 5 - result 3,4,5 rows
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS WITH TIES;         # 5 rows instead of 4 will be in output

***** OFFSET *****

OFFSET - to determine the starting point, optional, default = 0; number or rows (not %)
SELECT * FROM orders
OFFSET 5 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 2 ROWS ONLY;
