Ampersand substitution variable ia s feature of SQL*Plus (not part of SQL).
It is used in batch or interactive SQL*Plus processing.

Purpose: 
- to provide A SQL script with a run-time parameter feature when used within SQL*Plus sessions
- can represent any aspect of the SQL script statement (name of a table, keywords, SQL commands, data of any kind,
  such as input data for an INSERT/UPDATE, criteria of HAVING/GROUP BY, etc.)
- scope of variable - session

  1  SELECT room_number, style, window
  2  FROM ship_cabin
  3  WHERE room_number = &RNO          # prefix ampersand  &, variable name (alphanumeric, no spaces)
  4  ORDER BY room_number;             # During the execution you will be prompt to enter room number

  Legal syntax:  WHERE window = '&window_type'      # enter Ocean
                 WHERE windor = &window_type;       # enter 'Ocean'

During the execution - prompt:
Enter value for RNO:  --> entered 104
old  3: WHERE room_number = &RNO
new  3: WHERE room_number = 104

***** DEFINE & UNDEFINE commands *****

DEFINE - to see all existing defined variables

We can define substitution variable using DEFINE statement, so SQL will used this value when query is executed.

DEFINE vWindows = Ocean        #  no &; no semicolon at the end not required here (required for SQL statements)
                               Note: defined variables in a scope during the session.
UNDEFINE vWindows              # not define any longer in the sessionTo undefine:


***** SET & SHOW commands *****
SQL*Plus - SYSTEM variable:
  
  SET - to configure system variables
  SHOW - to display the particular system variable current state (ON or OFF)
  SHOW ALL - to see all system variables

>>> VERIFY

SET VERIFY OFF    - 'old' and 'new' lines won't be displayed (when you are prompt to enter value for var)
SET VERIFY ON    - to restore:


***** ACCEPT and PROMPT *****

PROMPT - command to display an interactive message to an end user
ACCEPT - will receive data from a user to store in a predefined variable.

>>> DEFINE System Variable

SET DEFINE ON  -to use substitotution variable DEFINE system variable must be set to ON. (it is ON by default).

SET DEFINE OFF  

SET DEFINE new_prefix   to change prefic of ampersand sustitution variable (prefix - single character)
SET DEFINE *       # changes & to *  

ECHO - command to display statements themselves

SET ECHO ON                        to see the statements
SET VERIFY OFF                      'old'/'new' won't be displayed
SET DEFINE OFF                      not to use substitution variable
SHOW DEFINE                         check the status of DEFINE
SET DEFINE *                        change prefix to asterisk, it eill automatically change status to ON
SHOW DEFINE                        check the DEFINE

SELECT room_numberm style, window 
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE window = '&Win';              using original prefix  - won't be recognized

SELECT room_numberm style, window 
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE window = '*Win';             will produce expected output
