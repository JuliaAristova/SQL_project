WHERE
- to identify rows that you want to include in SQL statement (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- optional
- followed by FROM
- consists on 1+ comparison(s)

SELECT port_name, capacity 
FROM ports
WHERE capacity >= 5;

>>> OPERATORs

=  >  >=  <  <= 
not equal:  !=    <>     ^=
IN    LIKE    IS

>>> COMPARING EXPRESSIONS

WHERE salary >= 50899 * 1.12
WHERE start_date < end_date

>>> COMPARING DATA TYPEs
In a single comparison, both expressions should be the same data type.
Comparison is case-sensitive by default.

Numeric - smaller numbers are less than greater numbers
Character - A < Z, Z , a, '2' > '10'
Dates - earlier dates are less than later dates.

>>> LIKE 
useful for performing wildcard searches on character data.

underscore (_) - single charackter; can be repeated
% - zero or more caracters

patterns put after LIKE in single quotes.

SELECT port_name FROM ports
WHERE port_name LIKE '_o%';  # Los Angeles; Honolulu

>>> BOOLEAN LOGIC 

AND  - both expressions must be true for the combination to be true. Otherwise it is false.
OR - at leaset one expression needs to be true for the combination to be true. Otherwise it is false.

NOT - infront of the expression to reverse its conslusion.
  SELECT employee_id FROM work_history
  WHERE ship_id = 3 AND 
                     NOT status = 'Pending'

WHERE NOT ship_id = 3    
WHERE ship_id != 3
WHERE ship_id <> 3

>>> OPERATOR PRECEDENCE - boolean expressions
1 - NOT
2 - AND
3 - OR

SELECT room_number FROM ship_cabin
WHERE style = 'Suite' OR style = 'Stateroom' AND window = 'Ocean';
# WHERE (style = 'Suite') OR (style = 'Stateroom' AND window = 'Ocean');

>>> IN

- can be used with dates, numbers, text espressions
- list of expressions must be in ( )
- expression must be the same/or similar data type
- one or more expressions separated by comma
- can use NOT IN

SELECT port_name FROM ports
WHRRE country IN ('UK', "USA', 'Bahamas');

>>> BETWEEN
- is inclusive
- range should be from lowest to highest (if not - output is zero rows)
- can use NOT BETWEEN

SELECT port_name FROM ports
WHRRE capacity BETWEEN 3 AND 4;      # (capacity >= 3 AND capacity <=4)

>>> IS NULL, IS NOT NULL

NULL = 'I do not know'

  SELECT port_name FROM ports
# WHERE capacity = NULL;         # returns no row
  WHERE capacity IS NULL;
