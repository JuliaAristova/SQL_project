GROUP BY - optional clause in SELECT (does not exist in any other statements)
Purpose: group sets of rows and treat each individual set as a whole.

SELECT room_style, ROUND(AVG(sq_ft), 2)
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE ship_id = 1
GROUPING BY room_style;      # group the rows that have the same value for room_style and compute the average for each group

GROUP BY:
- can specify any number of valid expressions, including columns of the table
- generally used to specify the columns that will contain common data in order to group rows together for performing some aggregations
- Select list can have only expressions that specified in GROUP BY and aggregate functions applied to those expressions
- Select list may not have expression specified in GROUP BY

SELECT room_type,
       TO_CHAR(AVG(sq_ft), 2), '999,999.99) "Average sq ft",
       MAX(guests) "Maximum # of guests",
       COUNT(ship_cabin_id) "Total # of cabins"
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE ship_id = 1
GROUPING BY room_type
OREDR BY 2 DESC;
