***** RANK: Analytic *****

RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p1 ORDER BY ob1) - calculates the rank of a value within a group of values.
  p1 - partition, optional
  ob1 - expression, required

- rank may bnot be consencutive numbers (because of a tied rows)

SELECT ship_cabin_id, room_style, sq_ft,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY room_style ORDER BY sq_ft) AS sq_ft_rank  # when a new room style starts< rank value restarts
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE chip_cabin_id <= 7
ORDER BY sq_ft;

***** RANK: Aggregate *****

RANK(c1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY e1)  - for eech c1 you have corresponding e1
  c1, e1 - expressions

SELECT RANK(533) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sq_ft)
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE ship_cabin_id <= 7
ORDER BY sq_ft;

*****DENSE_RANK: A *****

DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p1 ORDER BY ob1) - calculates the rank of a value within a group of values.
  p1 - partition, optional
  ob1 - expression, required

When a tie is encountered, the same value is assigned to each equivalent value; then next value gets the next sequential number (no gaps).

SELECT ship_cabin_id, room_style, sq_ft,
        DENSERANK() OVER(PARTITION BY room_style ORDER BY sq_ft) AS sq_ft_rank  # when a new room style starts< rank value restarts
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE chip_cabin_id <= 7
ORDER BY sq_ft;

***** DENSE_RANK: Aggregate *****

DENSE_RANK(c1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY e1)  - for eech c1 you have corresponding e1
  c1 - constant, numeric or character
  e1 - expression with a data type matching the corresponding c1 data type

***** FIRST & LAST *****

aggregate_function KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY e1)
aggregate_function KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY e1)\

For a given range of sorted values, each returns the first / last value of the population of rows defining e1, in the sorted order.

# display the highest number of square feet fro any and all cabins that accomodate the lowest number of guests.

SELECT MAX(sq_ft) KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY guests) "Largest"
FROM ship_cabins'
1 - sorting table by column guests identifying the FIRST (lowest values)
2 - for all rows withh lowest Guest value, determin the MAX(sq_ft)

SELECT RANK(533) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sq_ft)
FROM ship_cabins
WHERE ship_cabin_id <= 7
ORDER BY sq_ft;
