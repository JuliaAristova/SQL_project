INSERT
- to add one row at a time
- to add multiple rows at once (from source to target table)
- can be used with TABLE and VIEW objects

INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3...) VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);  #better approach 
                                             - will work if there is a structural changed in the table

or if colum names are omitted:
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);  # values must match order of the columns in target table

Note: 
- order of columns in INSERT does not need to match order of the columns in the table structure,
- does not need to include all columns in the table - Enumerated column list (list column names, values you want to insert)
- columns with constraint (NOT NULL, PK) must be inserted (if not - running time error)
- any columns with DEFAULT value assigned can be omitted
- order of values must match columns
- data type of inserted values must match or be compatible
- list of values may include expressions (result data type must be compatible with the target row)
- column constraint violation results in runtime error

INSERT INTO cruises (
  cruise_id, 
  cruise_type_id,
  cruise_name,
  captain_id,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  status)
VALUES (1, 1, 'Day At Sea', 101, '02-Jan-10', '09-Jan-10', 'Sched');

***** DATA TYPE CONVERSION *****

When INSERT INTO data types of values are compared to data types of columns - must be compatible.

Oracle provides implicit data type conversion if it is possible (ex, '101' --> 101, or 2020 --> '2020'), 
but encourage to use explicit conversion when necessary (TO_CHAR, TO_NUMBER, TO_DATE).

***** INSEET AND CONSTRAINTS *****
If constraint is violated --> runtime error 

Example, 
table: CONSTRAINT cruise_name_ck CHECK (cruise_name IN ('Haqaii', 'Bahamas', 'Bermuda', 'Mexico', 'Day at Sea')
sequence added: CREATE SEQUENCE seq_cruise_id;

# logically incorrect as it is a new sequence and NEXTVAL gives 1 
INSERT INTO cruises (cruise_id, cruise_name)
VALUES (seq_cruise_id.NEXTVAL, 'Hawaii');

# syntactically incorrect as cuise_name violated CHECK constraint 
INSERT INTO cruises (cruise_id, cruise_name)
VALUES (seq_cruise_id.NEXTVAL, 'Hawaii and Back');

Note: eventhough INSERT statement is failed sequence generator advanced by 1. Any attempt to invoke a sequence generator
will advance the number count, even if the DML statement fails.
