INSERT
- to add one row at a time
- to add multiple rows at once (from source to target table)
- can be used with TABLE and VIEW objects

INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3...) VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);  #better approach 
                                             - will work if there is a structural changed in the table

or if colum names are omitted:
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);  # values must match order of the columns in target table

Note: 
- order of columns in INSERT does not need to match order of the columns in the table structure,
- does not need to include all columns in the table - Enumerated column list (list column names, values you want to insert)
- columns with constraint (NOT NULL, PK) must be inserted (if not - running time error)
- any columns with DEFAULT value assigned can be omitted
- order of values must match columns
- data type of inserted values must match or be compatible
- list of values may include expressions (result data type must be compatible with the target row)
- column constraint violation results in runtime error

INSERT INTO cruises (
  cruise_id, 
  cruise_type_id,
  cruise_name,
  captain_id,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  status)
VALUES (1, 1, 'Day At Sea', 101, '02-Jan-10', '09-Jan-10', 'Sched');

***** DATA TYPE CONVERSION *****

When INSERT INTO data types of values are compared to data types of columns - must be compatible.

Oracle provides implicit data type conversion if it is possible (ex, '101' --> 101, or 2020 --> '2020'), 
but encourage to use explicit conversion when necessary (TO_CHAR, TO_NUMBER, TO_DATE).

***** INSEET AND CONSTRAINTS *****
If constraint is violated --> runtime error 

Example, 
table: CONSTRAINT cruise_name_ck CHECK (cruise_name IN ('Haqaii', 'Bahamas', 'Bermuda', 'Mexico', 'Day at Sea')
sequence added: CREATE SEQUENCE seq_cruise_id;

# logically incorrect as it is a new sequence and NEXTVAL gives 1 
INSERT INTO cruises (cruise_id, cruise_name)
VALUES (seq_cruise_id.NEXTVAL, 'Hawaii');

# syntactically incorrect as cuise_name violated CHECK constraint 
INSERT INTO cruises (cruise_id, cruise_name)
VALUES (seq_cruise_id.NEXTVAL, 'Hawaii and Back');

Note: eventhough INSERT statement is failed sequence generator advanced by 1. Any attempt to invoke a sequence generator
will advance the number count, even if the DML statement fails.

***** INSERT from another table using SELECT *****

INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE conditions;

Notes:
The columns in the INSERT INTO clause must match the columns and data types of the SELECT result.
You can apply transformations in the SELECT, like concatenating names or calculating values.
  Example:
  A source table called employees with columns: employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary.
  A target table called high_earners with columns: emp_id, full_name, salary.
  You want to insert employees with a salary greater than 10000 into high_earners.

  INSERT INTO high_earners (emp_id, full_name, salary)
    SELECT employee_id, first_name || ' ' || last_name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > 10000;

If you want to insert all rows from one table into another table with the same structure, you can omit the column list:
  INSERT INTO target_table
  SELECT * FROM source_table
  WHERE conditions;
