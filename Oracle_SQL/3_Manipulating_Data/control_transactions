TCL provide the functionality to save or undo the changes made with DML statements.
- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK
- SAVEPOINT

***** COMMIT *****
  
- saves changes to the DB since the session hegan or since the most recent commit in the session
- make changes to the DB permanent (cannot be ROLLBACK)

Transaction - series of SQL statement, considered as one union. Commit event completes transaction.

>>> EXPLICIT COMMIT - when COMMIT statement is executed.
        COMMIT;
        COMMIT WORK;  # WORK - optional

>>> IMPLICIT COMMIT - occurs automatically when certain DB events occur.
Events:
- immediately before and ofter an attempt to execute any DDL (Create, Alter, Drop, Grant, Revoke)
- normsl exit from most of Oracle's utilities and tools.
  
***** ROLLBACK *****
  
- undoes changes to the DB that have been performed within a given session and not committed.
- it does not remove any changes that have been committed.

COMMIT;
INSERT INTO ports (port_id, port_name) VALUES (701, 'Chicago');
DELETE FROM ships;
ROLLBACK;

Both, Insert and Delete, are reversed.
Both chages, performed uncommited DML statements are visible within the session until those changes are rolled back.

To undo changes to a particular SAVEPOINT:
ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;  
ROLLBACK WORK TO savepoint_name:

***** SAVEPOINT *****

- establishes demarcation points withina transaction to empower any following COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements
to subdivide the points at which data may later be optionally saved or undone.
- SAVEPOINT marks system change number (SCN).

COMMIT;
UPDATE ships SET home_port_id = 21 WHERE ship_id = 12;
SAVEPOINT SP_1;
UPDATE ships SET home_port_id = 22 WHERE ship_id = 12;
ROLLBACK WORK TO SP_1;                                    # hope_port_id = 21
COMMIT;

- All SAVEPOINT statements must include a name.
- savepoint names should not be duplicated within a single transaction (there in no syntax or runtime error,
  new SAVEPOINT will override earlier SAVEPOINT).
- once a commit event occurs all existing savepoints are erased from memory. Any references to them by future TCL 
  will produce an error.
- when try to rollback to a nonexistent SAVEPOINT --> error
