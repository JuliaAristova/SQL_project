Contains the query upon which the view is based (USER_VIEWS - TEXT column)
  SELECT TEXT 
  FROM USER_VIEWS
  WHERE VIEW_NAME = "VM_Employees'

View - a named query based on a table.
If the table structure is altered, then it may change the status of the view to INVALID.

To check a view status:

SELECT STATUS,
       OBJECT_TYPE,
       OBJECT_NAME
FROM USER_OBJECTS
WHERE STATUS = 'Invalid'
ORDER BY OBJECT_NAME;

You can recompile Invalid views.
