***** MERGE ROWS INTO TABLE *****

MERGE - combines the functionality of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, all into a single SQL statement.

If it is possible to use MERGE, then it is preferable to use it (more efficient - singe statement - single pass through DB)
Good for application built wit distributed architecture.

MERGE INTO table                                  # target - table or updatable view; required
USING table | subquery                            # source - table, view, subquery; required
ON condition                                      # behaves as WHERE; boolean; required; in practice usually comparing PK values
WHEN MATCHED THEN 
  UPDATE
    SET col = expression  DEFAULT
  WHERE clause
  DELETE where_clause
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (col1, col2)
                      VALUES (expr1, expr2  | DEFAULT)
                      wher_clause
WHERE condition;
