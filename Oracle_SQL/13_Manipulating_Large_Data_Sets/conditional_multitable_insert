Conditional multitable insert statemenr use conditional logic to determine which INTO clause(s) to process.
Each row returned by the subquery is processes through a series of one or more WHEN conditions.
Each WHEN condition is followed by a set of one or more INTO clases.

- for each row returned by the subquery, WHEN is evaluated 
  - if true - set of one or more INTO clauses is executed
  - if false - set of one or more INTO clauses is skipped, and the next WHEN is evaluated
- optional ELSE (after all WHEN/INTO)  defines its own set of one or more INTO clauses --> processes if all WHEN are skipped

Tables:
- invoices
- invoices_archived (invoices older than one year)
- WO_INV - third party information

Task: integrating data from another application
- pull data from WO_INV
- insert  WO_INV's invoice information within the past year into invoices table
- insert WO_INV's invoice information that is more than a year old into invoices_archived

INSERT FIRST
  WHEN (date_shipped < (ADD_MONTH(SYSDATE, -12)))   THEN
      INTO invoices_archived (invoice_id, invoice_date, shipping_date, account_number)
      VALUES                 (inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct)
  ELSE
      INTO invoices (invoice_id, invoice_date, shipping_date, account_number)
      VALUES                 (inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct)
 SELECT inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct
 FROM WO_INV;


- subquery - date_shipped
- WHEN compares date_shipped value 
- if WHEN returns true - data is inserted into invoice_archived table
- ELSE executed if WHEN returns false


INSERT                                                                           # statement will default to 'ALL' - each and every WHEN that is true will be executed
  WHEN (TO_CHAR(date_shipped, 'RRRR') < = '2019')   THEN
      INTO invoices_through_2019 (invoice_id, invoice_date, shipping_date, account_number)
      VALUES                     (inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct)
  WHEN (TO_CHAR(date_shipped, 'RRRR') < = '2018')   THEN                         # WHEN with 2 insertion when True
      INTO invoices_through_2018(invoice_id, invoice_date, shipping_date, account_number)
      VALUES                     (inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct)
      INTO invoices_closed (invoice_id, invoice_date, shipping_date, account_number)
      VALUES               (inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct)
  WHEN (TO_CHAR(date_shipped, 'RRRR') < = '2017')   THEN
      INTO invoices_through_2017 (invoice_id, invoice_date, shipping_date, account_number)
      VALUES                     (inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct)
SELECT inv_no, date_entered, date_shipped, cust_acct                            # there is no ELSE --> nothing will be executed for the row that does not match any WHEN 
FROM WO_INV;

>>> ALIASES

Table aliases are not recognizable. Use column aliases

INSERT 
  WHEN (boss_salary - employee_salary < 10000) THEN
    INTO salary_chart (emp_title, superior, emp_income. sup_income)
    VALUES            (employee, boss, employee_salary, boss_salary)
SELECT a.position_employee employee,
       b.position_boss     boss,
       a.max_salary        boss_salary,
FROM positions a 
     JOIN position b ON a.reports_to = b.position_id
WHERE a.max_salary > 100000;
