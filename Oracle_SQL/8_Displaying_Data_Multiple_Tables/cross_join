CROSS JOIN is a join of every row in the first table 
to every row in the second table

Example:
Table employee - 107 rows
Table departments = 27 rows

Cross join 1-7 * 27 - 1889 rows

Purpose: to produce test data

SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
[CROSS JOIN table2];

select e.last_name, e.department_id, d.department_name
from hr.EMPLOYEES e
CROSS JOIN hr.departments d
order by 2;
