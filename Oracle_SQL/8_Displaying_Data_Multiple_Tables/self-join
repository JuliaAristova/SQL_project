***** SELF-JOIN *****

- table is joined to itself
- the value in a column of a table compares to the value within another column in the same table
- returns 1+ rows from a table that are merged with other rows in the same table based on the join criteria
- can be inner or outer joins
- can be equijoins or non-equijoins
- FK is advised but not required to perform self-join

Table: Positions
Columns:
  position_id
  position
  reports_to --> position_id

1. Identify the table twice in FROM clause
2. Define join criteria (OUTER - to include the highest-level position that does not have report_to value)
3. Apply table alias to all appropriate references

SELECT a.position_id, a.position, b.position AS BOSS
FROM positions a 
LEFT OUTER JOINS positions b
ON a.position_id = b.position.id;
