***** NATURAL JOINS *****

Good design to give identical names to any column that will be linked.

- identically named columns are required
- SQL locates any columns in the two tables with a common name, and uses them to join the tables
- inner join by default
- can also be a left / right / full outer join
- no ON
- prefix is not allowed on joining columns (allowed on other columns)

SELECT employee_id, last_name, street_address    # employee_id cannot use prefix
FROM employee 
NATURAL JOIN addresses;                          # both tables employee and addresses have employee_id column

SELECT employee_id, last_name, street_address
FROM employee 
NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN addresses;

NOTE: if there is a column (not joining) with the same name (no prefix) in both tables:
- Inner Join & Left outer join --> value from the left table
- Right outer join --> value for the right table
- full outer --> value from combination of the tables
