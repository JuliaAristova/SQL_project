***** OUTER JOIN *****

Returns all the same data as an inner join but also returns additional rows that don't have matches in
all tables that are joined together.

>>> LEFT OUTER JOIN

SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships 
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN ports ON home_port_id = port_id    # OUTER - optional
ORDER BY ship_id;

- returns all ship_id even if there is no corresponding port_name (no matching home_port_id in ports)

>>> RIGHT OUTER JOIN

SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships 
RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN ports ON home_port_id = port_id    # OUTER - optional
ORDER BY ship_id;

- returns all port_name even if there is no corresponding ship_name (no matching port_id in ships)

>>> FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships 
FULL [OUTER] JOIN ports ON home_port_id = port_id    # OUTER - optional
ORDER BY ship_id;

- combines result LEFT and RIGHT JOINs

***** ORACLE OUTER JOIN SYNTAX *****

SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships, ports
WHERE home_port_id = port_id(+)    # LEFT OUTER JOIN, but(+) is on the right side  
ORDER BY ship_id;

SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships, ports
WHERE home_port_id(+) = port_id    # RIGHT OUTER JOIN, but(+) is on the leftt side
ORDER BY ship_id;

>>> FULL OUTER JOIN 
SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships, ports
WHERE home_port_id = port_id(+)  
UNION
SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
FROM ships, ports
