***** INNER JOINS *****

returns  a merged row from two or more tables if and only if there ate matched values among all joined tables.

- identify both tables in the FROM clause separated by the keywords INNER JOIN
- define the column from each table that is being used to join the data in the ON condition.

  SELECT ship_id, ship_name, port_name
  FROM ships 
  [INNER] JOIN ports ON home_port_id = port_id          # INNER - optional
  #WHERE port_name = 'Charleston'
  ORDER BY ship_id;

>>> Old Syntax - works, but inconsistent with ANSI standards.

SELECT s.ship_id, s.ship_name, p.port_name
FROM ships s, port p 
WHERE s.home_port_id = p port_id
#AND port_name = 'Charleston'
ORDER BY ship_id;

>>> Using Table Aliases

When writing any query in which a column reference is ambiguous, you must identify the column clearly using 
- a table prefix or 
- a table alias. 
Otherwise -  an error message and the SQL statement won't execute.

Table aliases can be used in SELECT, INSERT< UODATE< MERGE, and DELETE statements.
