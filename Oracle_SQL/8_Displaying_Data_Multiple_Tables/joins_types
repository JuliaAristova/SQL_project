Join - is a SELECT statement that retrieves data from 2+ tables and connects that data to return a merged set of rows. 
Tables must share common data elements that support joins (related to each other).

Types of joins:

>>> INNER JOIN & OUTER JOIN

- inner joins - connect rows in two or more tables if and only if there are matched rows in all the tables being joined.
- outer joins - connect rows in two or more tables in a way that is more inclusive - 
                if data exists in one table that has no matching values in another. 
                The unmatched row will still be included in the output.

>>> EQUIJOIN & NON-EQUIJOIN

- equijoins - connect data in two or more tables by looking for common data among the tables' column (exact match of data).
- non-equijoins - connect data by looking for relationship that don't involve equality 
                  (less than, greater than relationship, or range).

>>> Other: self joins, natural joins.
