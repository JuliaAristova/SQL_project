ORDER BY with SET operators

ORDER BY clause determines how to sort rows by identifying a series of one or more expressions.
ORDER BY accepts complex expressions (may include 1+ columns and perform some sort of transformation on the data).

ORDER BY clause is restricted to identifying common expression items in the select list.

If you combine a series of two or more SELECT statements with set operators,
your ORDER BY clause must be the final clause and can specify columns by name only if it uses the column names from the first SElECT statement,
regardless of how many SELECT statements might be connected with set operators.


***** ORDER BY - by position approach *****

SELECT 'Individual', last_name || ', ' || 'first_name'      #1 column - literal, 2 - column concatination of first and last name
FROM cruise_customers
UNION
SELECT category, vendor_name
FROM vendors
ORDER BY 2;                      # ordering by concatinated name

***** ORDER BY - by reference *****

When using ORDER BY reference, the column name in force is whatever column name exists in the firs SELECT statement.

SELECT 'Individual' AS contact_category, 
last_name || ', ' || 'first_name' AS point_of_contact     
FROM cruise_customers
UNION
SELECT category, vendor_name
FROM vendors
ORDER BY point_of_contact          #alias from first Select
