CONVERSION FUNCTIONS
- to convert from one data type to another
- once converted value can be used as input to some other functions
- some conversion functions provide formatting

DATA TYPES:
- numeric (NUMBER)
- text (VARCHAR2)
- date and/or time (DATE, TIMESTAMP, etc.)

Conversion:
- explicit
- implicit
  
***** IMPLICIT CONVERSION *****

Automatically, SQL will determine that a data type conversion is requiered but not specified.
SELECT 'Chapter ' || 1 || '...I am born.' FROM SELECT;  # Chapter 1 ... I am born

SELECT SYSDATE, 
       ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, SUBSTR('plus 3 months', 6, 1)) plust_three  # substring returns '3'
FROM DUAL;

Good practice: to avoid dependence on automatic data type conversion

- Numeric values will generally not convert automatically to dates.
- Numeric and text data will generally not covnert automatically to very large sized types (LOB, CLOB. RAW, etc.)
- Very large types will generally not automatically convert to each other (ex. from BLOB to CLOB)

***** EXPLICIT CPNVERSION ******
- easy to read
- result in better performance (implicit conversion usullly longer processing time)
- recommended to use
