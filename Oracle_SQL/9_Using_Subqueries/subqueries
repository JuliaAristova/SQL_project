SUBQUERY - SELECT statement witin a larger SELECT statement (child query inside of parent query = outer= top level)

- subquery can be in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, and DELETE
- can be used in DDL - CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW
- can be stand-alone or correlated ((they contain references that tie them into their parent queries)
- can return 1+ columns, 1+ rows; output usually used by parent query
- parent query can contain  few child queries
- subqueries can be nested (top-level, outer query - inner query)
- subquery often retrieve data from other table(s) than parent query does; no logical relationship needed

USAGE:
- Creating complex multistage queries:
  1 - subquery filters some data with WHERE
  2 - pass the data to another subquery - secondary answer
  3 - pass the answer to parent query
- Creating populated tables - can be incorporated into CREATE TABLE statement or UPDATE to move large amount of data from one source to another
- Creating named views - create a view objects containing required information
- Defining dynamic view - to replace a table reference in a FROM clause (inline view)
- Defining dynamic expressions with scalar subqueries - subquery return only one column's worth of data in one row - single value (alternative to expression)
