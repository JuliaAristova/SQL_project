Single-row subquery - returns one row

Single-row subqueries are useful for performing multistep queried when you can guarantee that the subquery 
will return a single row.

Task: find employees who assigned to the same ship as Al Smith

SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name 
FROM employees
WHERE ship_id = ( SELECT ship_id                      # = --> expected single-row
                  FROM employees
                  WHERE firts_name = 'Al' AND last_name = 'Smith')
AND NOT (firts_name = 'Al' AND last_name = 'Smith');

To ensure that subquery returns 1 row response:
- WHERE with PK or other unique value --> will return only one value
- subquery returns aggregate function (SELECT MIN(ship_id) ...)
- use ROWNUM (WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND ROWNUM < 2)
- if subquery returns 0 row --> NULL value --> to parent query
