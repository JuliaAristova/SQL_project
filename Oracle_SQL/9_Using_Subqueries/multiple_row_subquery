Multiple-row subquery may return more than one row of answers to the parent query.

SELECT ship_id, last_name, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE ship_id IN ( SELECT ship_id FROM employees    # IN allows subquery to return multiple values
                   WHERE last_name = 'Smith')
ORDER BY ship_id, last_name;

>>> Multirow subquery comparison conditions
- IN - compares to a set of zero or more values
- NOT - used with IN to reverse the results
- ANY - used in combination with single-row comparison conditions (=. >, <). TRUE if at list one row matched
- SOME - same as ANY
- ALL -  used in combination with single-row comparison conditions. Consistemnty match with each row
         SELECT * FROM products
         WHERE price > ALL ( SELECT price FROM products WHERE category = 'Luxury');

  Note:
  NOT IN comparison operator runs the risk not to identify rows if there are some NULLs. Solution - to exclude NULLs

  SELECT * FROM parent
  WHERE house NOT IN ( SELECT house FROM kid
                        WHERE house is NOT NULL)
