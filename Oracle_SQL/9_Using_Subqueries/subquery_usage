***** Problems Subquery can Solve *****

- ideal for finding data that is at the top of some scale, below/above average, somthing comparable
  
  example: Find all sales representative whose total sales was above avg sale in previous year
  SELECT rep
  FROM sales_data
  WHERE year = 2018 and total_sales > ( SELECT AVG(total_sales) avg_sales
                                        FROM sales_data
                                        Where year = 2017)

  - populate a table using 0 to more source rows within INSERT statement
  - create a VIEW
  - to specify values assigned to an UPDATE statement
  - to perform comparisons against aggregated results
  - to create inline views - subquery in FROM clause of SELECT statement (can be multiple levels)
  - as an alternative to expressions
  - to nest other queries (in the WHERE clause, up to 255 queries)
  - to have a correlated subquery within a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE
