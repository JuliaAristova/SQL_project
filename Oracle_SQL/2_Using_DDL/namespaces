***** Namespaces *****

A namespace is a logical boundary within the DB that encompasses a particular set of DB objects. 
There are several namespaces at work at any given time.

You must provide unique names  for an object within its own namespaces/
Objects that share a namespace must have unique names within that namespace.
Object in different namespaces are allowed to have identical names.

Example:

DB:
Schema 1 - Namespace (Constraints)
           Namespace (Indexes)
           Namespace (Tables, Views, Sequences, Private Synonyms, User-Defined Types)
           Namespace (Users, Roles)
Schema 2 - Namespace (Constraints)
           Namespace (Indexes)
           Namespace (Tables, Views, Sequences, Private Synonyms, User-Defined Types)
           Namespace (Public Synonymes)

you can create Work_Schedule table in both schemas
you cannot create Work_Schedule TABLE and Work_Schedule VIEW in the same schema, 
you can create a Work_Schedule TABLE and Work_Schedule CONSTRAINT, and INDEX, and Role in the same schema
