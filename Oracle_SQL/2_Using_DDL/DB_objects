DB consisits of one or more DB objects.

Schema is a logical collection of certain DB objects, such as tables indexes, and views, 
all of each are owned by a user account. (Schema = user account)

***** Categories of DB objects *****

1. Schema objects - owned by a user account
       - tables
       - constraints
       - indexes
       - views
       - sequencies
       - private synonyms - owned by a user account
2. Non-schema objects - cannot be owned by a user account
       - users - user account cannot be owned by itself or another account. It is a property of DB as a whole.
       - roles - one or more priviligies that can be granted to one or more USER objects.
       - public synonyms - available to the whole DB

Subject of the exam:

TABLE  - structure that can store data. All data stored in columns and rows.Each column datarype is explicitly defined.
INDEX - object designed to support faster search in a table.
VIEW - a 'filter' through which you can search a table and interact with a table but that stores no data inseld and simply 
       serves as a 'window' onto ine or more tables. It can mask a portion of the underlying table(s).
SEQUENCE - a counter, often used to generate unique numbers as identifiers for new rows as they are added to a table.
SYNONYM - an alias for another object in the DB, often used to specify an alternative name for a table or view
CONSTRAINT - a small bit of logic defined by you to instruct a particular table about how it will accept.
            modify. or reject incoming data.
USERS - the 'owner' of DB objects.
ROLES - a set of one or more priviligies that can be granted to a user.

***** CREATE OBJECT *****

CREATE objectType objectName attributes;

Note: you cannot create a CONSTRAINT in this way
Create PRIVATE SYNONYM or Create SYNONIM (for public)

attributes - 0+ series of clauses that are unique for each individual object type.
