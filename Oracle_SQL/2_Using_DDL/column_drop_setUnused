If there are some columns you do not need, you can drop them or set as unused.
  
***** DROP COLUMN *****
  
- Any constraints or indeces will be also droped
- you cannot remove final remaining column in the a table, at least one column must remain in the table

ALTER TABLE order_returns DROP COLUMN criuse_order_date;   # limited to 1 column
or 
ALTER TABLE order_returns DROP (cruise_order_date);        # multiple columns separated by comma

Note:
- if a column is referenced by a FK constraint in another table, dropping it will result in error
- you can delete FK column in a child table directly (column and constraint will be removed)
- if FK is compound, you must to use CASCADE CONSTRAINT if you want to remove only one column

ALTER TABLE order_returns 
DROP (cruise_order_id, cruise_order_date); 
or
ALTER TABLE order_returns 
DROP COLUMN cruise_order_id
CASCADE CONSRTRAINTS;          # will drop the column and any constraints of the column    (CONSTRAINT or CONSTRAINTS)

DROP COLUMN ... CASCADE CONSTRAINT - drops the column and drops the associated constraints on the column 

***** UNUSED *****
  
- Once a column has been set to UNUSED, it can never be recovered (ROLLBACK statement will have no effect)
- You can add a new column with the same name as the column set UNUSED
- Any constraints or indeces on the column will be also droped
- Fast execution (you can DROP column later)
- 1000 is limit of columns in a table. If you set a column is UNUSED, it is still count as a part of a table.
- you cannot SET UNUSED final remaining column in the a table, at least one column must remain in the table
- USER_UNUSED_COL_TABS - gives you names of any and all tables that contain unused columns
- error when you try to SET UNUSED not-existing column or a column with constraint
- to see UNUSED columns - data dictionary view USER_UNUSED_COL_TABS (list of tables that contains them, not column names)

ALTER TABLE order_returns SET UNUSED COLUMN criuse_order_date;   # limited to 1 column
or 
ALTER TABLE order_returns set unused (criuse_order_date);        # multiple columns separated bu comma

To drop unused columns:

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP UNUSED COLUMNS;
