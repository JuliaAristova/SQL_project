EXTERBAL TABLE  - read-only table that defined within the DB but exists outside the DB (its metadate stored in the DB, its data - outside of DB).
                  The process that supports them has its root and syntax in the SQL*Loader tool or Oracle Data Pump.
- can query with SELECT
- can create an index
- cannot use any other DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- do not accept any constraints

Flat data transfer: data source (web source reference, spreadsheet apps, legacy 3GL apps) can be structured the way that SQL external table can recognize
and be able to query.

***** CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE *****

- can declare columns and data types
- can populate with a subquery 
- LOB (CLOB, BLOB, NCLOB) cannot be used
- cannot add constraints
- cannot set UNSUED (column will be dropped)

***** DIRECTORY OBJECTs *****

- identify the location of an external file containing the table

CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY directory_name 
AS directory_reference;                       # in single quotes

Example:
CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY Bank_Fies
AS 'F:\bnk_files\trnsfr';                     # DB now has object Bank_Files

After creating --> grant access (READ or/and WRITE)

GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY
directory_name TO username;

***** ORACLE UTILITIES *****
- SQL* Loader
- Oracle Data Pump Export
- Oracle Data Pump Import

Utilities provide capabilities that allow external data sources to communicate with SQL objectswithin the DB.

***** CREATING EXTERNAL TABLE *****

Data:
INVOICE_DATA.txt
ID      INV_DATE      ACCT_NO
-------------------------------
701    03/15/09        CODDA009
702    03/17/09        CODDA010
703    03/18/09        CODDA011

File System:
- navigate to the drive where the DB resided
- create subdir (LOAD_INVOICES) off of the root level
- put INVOICE_DATA.txt in LOAD_INVOICES

CREATE DIRECTORY INVOICE_FILES AS '\LOAD_INVOICES';
