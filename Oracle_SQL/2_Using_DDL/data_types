Each columns must be assigned a data type. 
A column data tye defines what sort of information is and is not accepted as input into the column.
  
Categories (built-in):
- numeric
- character 
- date
- LOB - large object - can include charager data, but cannot be included in a primary key,
        DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, or joins

It is possiblle for users to create their own unique "user-defined" data types. (CREATE TYPE)
          
  ***** NUMERIC TYPE *****

  NUMBER(n,m) - accepts 0, negative, positive numbers
          n - precision (max numbers of digits before and after decimal point; optional; range 1-38
          m - scale (maximum number of digits after decimal point); optional; range -84 - 127
          if n is specified, m is omited - m defaults to  0
          when n is specified and greated number is inserted -- error
          m - is rounded to (-m - specifies how many significant digits to the left of the decimal point will be punded off)

          NUMBER(2)      4.56    --> 5
          NUMBER(5, 2)   4.56    --> 4.56
          NUMBER(5,2)    4.5678  --> 4.57
          NUMBER(5, -2)  1059.34 --> 1100
          NUMBER(3, 2)   14.56   --> error


  *** CHARACTER TYPE *****
          
  CHAR(n) - fixed length alphanumeric value (max n, optional). 
            If value < n - spaces are added, if > n - error. Default max = 2000
  VARCHAR2(n) - 'variable character', fixed lengt alphanumeric value (max n, must be specified, 1 char upto 4000 bytes). 
            Does not add blanks to values.

***** DATE *****
Date type consists of fields (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, timezone_hour,timezone_minute, 
timezone_region, tmiezone_abbr). Each fiels is a component of a date or time.
                         
DATE  - accepts date and time information. Fields include year, month, date, hour, minute, and second.
        Date literals - in a single quotes.
              

                         
TIMESTAMP(n) - extension to DATE (adds fractional second precision). n range 0-9, if omitted - 6
TIMESTAMP(n) WITH TIME ZONE - variation of TIMESTAMP (adds time zone region name or an offset for time zone)
                         n range 0-9, if omitted - 6
                      
TIMESTAMP(n) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE - variation of TIMESTAMP. Offset(n) is not stored, it is calculated automatically
                         when value is accessed from a different time sone. (if omitted n = 6)
INTERVAL YEAR(n) TO MONTH - stores a span of time defined in inly year and month values. 
                         n - number of digits used to define the YEAR value.
                         n range 0-9, if omitted - 2
INTERVAL DAY(n1) TO SECOND(n2)- stores a span of time defined in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. 
                         n1 - precisions for days (n range 0-9, if omitted - 2)
                         n2 - precision for seconds (n range 0-9, if omitted - 6)

***** LARGE OBJECTS *****

BLOB - 'binary large object' (image, video files, starting size 4 GB)
CLOB - 'character large object' (accepts text data elements)
NCLOB - accepts CLOB data in Unicode

Note: Oracle corporation discourages to use LONG and encourages to convert LONG data types to LOB data types.
