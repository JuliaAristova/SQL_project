Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERM)

- ERD is a logical model of an existing business
- The entities in an ERD are the "things" that can form the basos pf a business information system
  and that are transformed intp tables in a DB
- ERD is a logical representation of a business; the relational DB is the physical model in which
  actual data can be housed and processed in support pf the business process

The table is a physical implementation of an entity (columns is physical implementation of an entity's attribute).
Relationship specifies how two entities relate to each other.

PRIMARY KEY - unique identifier for a row in a particular table.
FOREIGN KEY - a copy of some (or all) of one table's Primary key data in a second table,
so that the second table can relate to the first.

Relationship between entities:
- one-to-one
- one-to-many
- many-to-many

The presence many-to-many relationship is a flag - data model is missing an entity (this entity is more abstract by nature)
