***** FLASHBACK OPERATIONS *****

Some features required Oracle Enterprise Editions (ex., Flashback Table)

To recover object/data it contains
- Recovering complete tables you may have inadvertently dropped
-  Recovering data changes within one or more tables resulting from a series of DML statements
- Performing data analysis on data that;s been changed over perions of time
- Comparing data that existed at one point in time with data that existed at another point in time
- Performingqueries as of a prior time period.

>>> RECOVER DROPPED TABLES

FLASHBACK TABLE 
Identify point of time:
= Immediately prior to when a table was dropped
- A specific time identified by a value of TIMESTAMO
- A specific transaction identified by the system change number (SCN)
- A predetermined event identified by a database object known as the RESTORE POINT

FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO ...
     FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO BEFORE DROP;     
     FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO new_table_name;
FLASHBACK TABLE table_1, table_2, table_3 TO ...

RECYCLE BIN
 
After DROP TABLE, it is automatically placed into the Recycle bin.
If a table is in the Recycle bin it can be restored.

A user account’s dropped objects are retained in a separate recycle bin for each user.

SELECT * FROM USER_RECYCLEBIN;     or 		
SELECT * FROM RECYCLEBIN;
SELECT * FROM DBA_RECYCLEBIN;		//DBA privileges

Settings (initialization parameter file):
ALTER SESSION SET recyclebin = ON;
ALTER SESSION SET recyclebin = OFF;

>>> Dependent Objects

When table is recoverd, any accosiated dependent objects are also recovered:
- indexes(except bitmap), with System assigned names (not user assigned)
- constraints (not FK)
- some other objects (ex, triggers)

>>> PURGE

permanently removed table from the Recycle Bin
PURGE TABLE table_name;
PURGE RECYCLEBIN;   --> to purge the schema's recycle bin entirely

>>> FLASHBACK EXISTING TABLE

1. FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO SCN scn_expression;

SCN is incremented each time a transaction is committed, and stored with each row in each table.
SELECT ORA_ROWSCN , column_name
FROM table_name;

      SELECT DBMS_FLASHBACK.GET_SYSTEM_CHANGE_NUMBER FROM DUAL;

FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO TIMESTAMP timestamp_expression;
       Possible where ROW MOVEMENT feature is enabled.

CREATE TABLE table_name (col	DATATYPE, …)
ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

ALTER TABLE table_name
ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO RESTORE POINT  restore_point_expression;
   Restore poit - DB object you create to represent a given moment in the DB,

   CREATE RESTORE POINT balance_acct_01; 
   FLASHBACK TABLE balances TO RESTORE POINT balance_acct_01;
