Shema objects - owned by a user and exist in a collection within a user account.

***** TABLES *****

Table - to store data
When a table is created - metadata --> Data Dictionary (managed automatically)

Columns stored in the order they are created.
If you ALTER a table and add a column --> new column will be added at the end of the list of the columns.

***** CONSTRAINTS *****

Constraint - rule on a table that restricts the values that can be added to a table columns.
It is not a DB object, but it is listed in Data Dictionary.
Types of constriants: 
  NOT NULL
  INIQUE
  REIMARY KEY
  FOREIGN KEY
  CHECK

If you try to add/delete row to/from a table that violates a constraint --> execution error

***** VIEW *****

VIEW - acts like a table. It stores no data. It is a SELECT statement that is saved in the DB with a name assigned to it.
You can:
- describe view with DESCRIBE
- query view with SELECT
- depends on a view you might be able to INSERT, UPDATE, and/or DELETE statements on a view to manipulate the contents of the underlying tables.

***** INDEXES *****

When you create an INDEX object, you are identifying one or more columns in a table that supposed to be frequently used to look up data.
Then you create an index based on that column(s). Then Oracle builds a separate object that takes a unique list of all the data 
currently in that column, sort it accordint to data type, and then stores internal addressing information that ties the index to the source table 
and the rows contained them.
Indexes can be very beneficial for performance.

***** SEQUENCES *****

A Sequence is a counter, issues a number in a particular series, always keeping track of whatever the next number should be.
Purpose - to support the process of adding rows to a particular table.
