Purpose - to convert data values from one data type to another.
Do not change values, but type.

***** IMPLICIT VONCERSION *****
Occurs automatically where SQL will determine on its own that a data type conversion is required byt not specified.

SELECT 'Chapter ' || 1 || '....I am born.' FROM DUAL;   # 1 - numeric value - character conversion appens automatically

SELECT SYSDATE,
       ADD_MONTH(SUBSTR('plus 3 months', 6, 1) AS plus_three     # SUBSTR --> 3 - string, automatically converted to numeric
FROM DUAL;

Oracle recommends to use explicit conversion where possible.

Rules for automatic data type conversion:
- numeric values will generally not convert automatically to dates
- numeric and text data will generally not convert automatically to very large sized types (LOB, CLOB, RAW, and others)
- very large types will generally not automatically convert to each other, such as fffrom BLOB to CLOB (some will, but not many)

- Easy to read
- Better performance
- Recommended to use
