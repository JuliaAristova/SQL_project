CTE - Common Table Expression 
Temporary, names result set, that can be used multiple times within your query to simplify and organize complex query.

Note: you cannot use ORDER BY in CTE

- Standalone (can be multiple) - can be run independently
- Nested - CTE inside another CTE (uses its result ==> cannot be run independently)
- Recursive - self-referencing query that repeatedly processes data until a specific condition is met.

--multiple
WITH CTE_name as (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...), 
     CTE_name_2 as (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
SELECT ...
FROM CTE_name
JOIN CTE_name_2
WHERE ...

Advantages:
- Readability - breaks down complex queries into smaller pieses (DO NOT OVERUSE)
- Modularity - pieces are easy to manage, develop, and self-contained
- Reusability - reduce redundancy in query
- Recursive - looping in SQL
