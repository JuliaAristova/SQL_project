SET Operators - combunes 2+ separate SELECT statements so that their output is merged in some manners
The Set operators are useful for requirements to combine the data of two tables into one output result set 
when the two tables have no primary key/foreign key relationship with each other.


UNION - combines row sets. Eliminates duplicate row sets
UNION ALL - comb=ines row sets. Does not eliminate duplicate row sets
INTERSECT - includes only those row sets that are present in both queries
MINUS - subtracts the rows in the second row set from the rows in the first row set.

Rules:
- number of espression in each SELECT must be the same
- data type of eash expression must match (identicak or can be made to be indentical through automation conversion)
- large data types (BLOB, CLOB) cannot be used 
- ORDER BY can be included only in the last SELECT statement (without ORDER there is no guarantee the ordering of rows in any Select statements)
- name of the headings in result is taken from the first Select statement
- set operators can be combined together (use parenthersis, check usage of ORDER to avoid errors)
