Window operations perform calcultaion (aggregation) on a specific subset of data, without loosing the level of details.
They are more powerful and dynamic then GROUP BY. 
They allows to perform advanced data analysis

TYPES:
- AGGREGATE functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
- RANK functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), CUME_DIST(), PERCENT_RANK(), NTILE(_
- VALUE (ANALITIC) funtions: LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()

FUNCTION expression  OVER (PARTITION BY clause    ORDER BY clause FRAME clause) 

PARTITION BY - divides the dataset into windows(partitions). If omitted - the whole dataset. You can partition by a single or combined columns
ORDER BY - sort the data in a window. Optional for Aggregate functions, but MUST have for Rank and Valu functions
FRAME clause - defines a subset of rows within each window that is relevant for calculation
  Frame type:
  - ROWS   
  - RANGE 
  CURRENT ROW, N PRECEEDING, N FOLLOWING, UNBOUNDED PRECEDING (first row), UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING (last row)
  Default - BETWEEN UNBOUNCED PRECEEDING AND CURRENT ROW

Rules:
1. Window functions can be used only in SELECT and ORDER BY
2. Nesting window functions are not allowed
3. Window functions are executed adter WHERE clause
3. WIndow functions can be used together with GROUP BY in the same query ONLY if the same columns are used.
